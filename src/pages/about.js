        How did I get into tech? I love learning new things. Naturally, tech was the perfect place to be. 
        Itâ€™s always changing and always moving forward. 
        First, I used jQuery, then Angular and now I use React for Front-End. Besides I used ASP.Net MVC but now I use Go for Back-End. 
        Some people might find this frustrating but I love it. 
        You need to never run out of things to learn to capture technology .
